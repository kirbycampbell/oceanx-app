Hello!

This project is live at [Drink Manager](https://the-one-who-works.herokuapp.com/) - be aware it may take 10 seconds to load at first due to the free Heroku Teir delays.

This app was built with a Rails & Ruby Backend API with a React & Redux Front End & State Management. 

See the Backend at [drinks_controller.rb](https://github.com/kirbycampbell/oceanx/blob/master/app/controllers/drinks_controller.rb).
See the FrontEnd interact with the Backend at [drinkActions.jsx](https://github.com/kirbycampbell/oceanx/blob/master/client/src/Redux/actions/drinkActions.jsx).
The new Drink form creation can be viewed at [NewDrinkForm.js](https://github.com/kirbycampbell/oceanx/blob/master/client/src/Redux/container/NewDrinkForm.jsx)
